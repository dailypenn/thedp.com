She said the \"Parks and Recreation\" theme was an attempt to revitalize Valentine’s Day to appeal to young adults at the museum.</p>\n<p>\"We wanted to do something for Valentine’s Day, but we’re trying to think of a way to revisit it in a more fresh and young-adult friendly way,\" Evans said. \"[This event is] bringing in pop culture but in a really relevant way to our collections.\"</p>\n<p>The event included Leslie Knope staples, including a waffle bar, scrapbooking, and a civic engagement volunteer circle. The circle featured organizations such as <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Planned Parenthood</a>, a provider for reproductive healthcare, which set up tables to talk about their mission.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The museum celebrated impactful women with a “Badass Ladies Trivia” and a tour of the museum that showcased the lives of influential women in anthropology. Other activities included feminist button making, a photobooth with frame decorating, a make-your-own-perfume station, and writing love notes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brittany Carney, a 32-year-old former Philadelphia resident, performed a stand-up comedy set, joking about topics ranging from her day job as a pre-school teacher to her love life.</p>\n<p>She began her set by explaining her personal connection to Philadelphia and the Penn Museum. After living in Tokyo, Japan, she attended high school in Philadelphia, where she was once hired by the Penn Museum.</p>\n<p>Carney's set included politically-relevant topics, such as climate change, race, and gender identity. &nbsp;</p>\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"75c3c179-2c6f-4398-815c-58d795cfaebc\" data-uuid=\"75c3c179-2c6f-4398-815c-58d795cfaebc\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/e73bf568-501f-45dc-af33-00e03efe9294.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"835.421875\" data-height=\"556.796875\" data-align=\"\" />\n<p>Carney, who now lives in New York City, said she began doing stand-up in 2014 in Washington, D.C.
