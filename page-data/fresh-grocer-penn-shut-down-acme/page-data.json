The Fresh Grocer is assisting each of its Walnut Street Fresh Grocer associates with placement at other stores in the company, Spross said.</p>\n<p>College junior Danny Cooper, an Under The Button staff writer who worked as a cashier at an Acme in New Jersey during high school summers, said his experience working for Acme was much like working at any other grocery store. Cooper said the time between the Fresh Grocer's closing and when a new store will open will be \"very inconvenient\" to students who rely on the Fresh Grocer to buy groceries.</p>\n<p>\"I’m also worried that there will be a period of time during the school year where there’s no supermarket there,\" College sophomore Eden Vance said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cooper added he thinks an Acme store will be more expensive than the Fresh Grocer.</p>\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"9425c7f1-46f6-4998-8b11-d51746fdc8e6\" data-uuid=\"9425c7f1-46f6-4998-8b11-d51746fdc8e6\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/09353b30-aa88-474a-8d93-d2b7429c186c.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"835.421875\" data-height=\"556.796875\" data-align=\"\" />\n<p>Vance, who shops at the Fresh Grocer a few times a month, said he thinks replacing the supermarket with another one is a good idea because he does not trust the health and sanitation practices at the store.</p>\n<p>The Fresh Grocer <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/08/fresh-grocer-health-violation-close-supermarket\" target=\"_blank\">closed</a> temporarily in August 2019 after inspection officials found three instances of \"foodborne illness risk factors\" and six instances of a \"lack of good retail practices,\" according to a <a href=\"http://data.inquirer.com/inspections/philly/?detail=The%20Fresh%20Grocer%7C4001%20WALNUT%20ST%2019104\" target=\"_blank\">report </a>from the Philadelphia Inquirer's Clean Plates project.
