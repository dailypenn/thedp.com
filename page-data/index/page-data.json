There were no options to retrieve important items, including laptops, course materials, and personal effects, but students with emergency situations could email and ask for an item to be shipped, according to the email.</p>\n<p>Fewer than a <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/penn-housing-residential-services-retrieval-belongings\" target=\"_blank\">dozen</a> items that were<strong> </strong>deemed essential, including specialized medical equipment and documents needed for immigration or visa status, were retrieved and shipped to students during the spring<strong> </strong>semester.</p>\n<p>Rising College sophomore Chase Seklar said Residential Services denied his request on April 7 to mail his prescription and retrieve his textbooks from his room in Hill College House, which caused him to struggle in his classes this semester.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Seklar said he thought Residential Services'<strong> </strong>survey deadline of May 27, which gives students less than a week to decide if and how to retrieve their items, is an<strong> </strong>unreasonable amount of time to decide whether they would return to campus to move out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rising College sophomore Keaton Mackey said Residential Services also denied her multiple requests in March and April to retrieve and ship her social security card, dental retainer, and textbooks.</p>\n<p>“I really don’t know anyone who got their stuff, no matter how urgent. I reached out to [Residential Services] a few different times, and they kept saying it wasn’t urgent,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mackey echoed Seklar's concern, and said the email did not give students enough notice before the allowed<strong> </strong>period in June<strong> </strong>to return to campus. She currently lives with her family in California, and will have her items stored until she moves into her off-campus apartment in July.</p>\n<p>“I live on the opposite side of the country. It's really not possible for me to fly out to Philadelphia on such short notice because of cost and because it's just dangerous to fly,\" Mackey said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rising Wharton sophomore Christine Kim, a summer Opinion columnist for the DP, said she believes Residential Services should pay to ship returning students’ items. Institutions such as <a href=\"https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2020/05/duke-university-whats-up-packing-students-reunited-belongings-at-last-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">Duke University</a> and <a href=\"https://www.northwestern.edu/coronavirus-covid-19-updates/resources/frequently-asked-questions/student-housing-information.html\" target=\"_blank\">Northwestern University</a>, for example, will allow returning students to ship up to four boxes and unlimited boxes, respectively, for free.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It was very disappointing to see that we have to pay for shipping, because it seems very stingy. It was [Residential Services’] planning and inconvenience that led us to this current situation,” Kim said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other students, however, said they found the options flexible and reasonable given the circumstances of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>“I wish [Residential Services] shipped everyone’s items for free, but obviously that would be a huge financial burden,\" rising College sophomore Poojita Chinmay said. \"I don’t really expect that of them.\"</p>\n<p>Rising College junior Diya Singh said she was grateful Penn will cover the cost of storage for her belongings. Singh is currently at her home in New Delhi, and will not be able return to campus to retrieve her items because of the distance from India.</p>\n<p>Rising College sophomore Rebecca Hennessy said she appreciated the flexibility of Residential Services' policy. She said she plans on video-calling movers as they pack her room ⁠— an option listed in the Residential Services email ⁠— and will have some of her belongings shipped to her home in New Jersey and the rest stored by the University until next year.</p>","infobox":null,"template":null,"short_token":"f41fbbd40b","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"75665","created_at":"2020-05-25 22:26:58","modified_at":"2020-05-26 04:57:57","published_at":"2020-05-26 04:57:25","metadata":[],"hits":"35","normalized_tags":"|132|27|","ceo_id":"189504","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"132","uuid":"9b693701-241e-45f3-a430-018489cdba1a","name":"top","slug":"top","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"41"},{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"}],"authors":[{"id":"7492","uuid":"62fa0c9a-2d1a-44c5-ae3d-6ead8cd55ba8","name":"Lindsey Perlman","email":"","slug":"lindsey-perlman","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"8142","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"75665","uuid":"552f1459-9e4a-4c17-bfac-1b6cf580d795","attachment_uuid":"62300ffd-36a4-452f-bffc-8fe7203b5a28","base_name":"move-out-penn-residential-services","seo_title":null,"seo_description":null,"seo_image":null,"extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Move Out Penn Residential Services.jpg","content":"<p>Students who have not moved out from the College Houses may return to campus between June 4 and June 13 to retrieve their belongings, or have their items packed and stored at no cost.</p>","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"3712","width":"5568","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-05-22 02:26:55","modified_at":"2020-05-26 00:51:26","published_at":"2020-05-22 02:28:32","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"189420","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"transcoded":"0"}},{"id":"87568","uuid":"1dae14d8-6d86-4f8c-aa39-12e4e006a0be","slug":"wharton-coronavirus-pandemic-online-course-mauro-guillen","seo_title":null,"seo_description":null,"seo_image":null,"headline":"Wharton coronavirus course taken by over 2,400 people deemed a success by students, faculty","subhead":null,"abstract":"<p>Guest lecturers included Penn President Amy Gutmann, National Bureau of Economic Research Fellow Kent Smetters, and Wharton Dean Geoffrey Garrett, among others.</p>","content":"<p>After the end of this semester, the over 2,400 students and faculty who participated in Wharton’s six-week course on the COVID-19 pandemic largely agree it was an overwhelming success.</p>\n<p>The course, entitled MGMT 198: Epidemics, Natural Disasters, and Geopolitics: Managing Global Business and Financial Uncertainty, was <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/penn-wharton-online-course-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">created</a> by Wharton Management professor Mauro Guillén and featured 17 different lecturers throughout the semester's six three-hour long lectures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Approximately 2,444 students — 1,944 for credit and around 500 auditors — participated in the online course, coming from all four undergraduate schools as well as many University graduate programs.</p>\n<p>Guillén said he was pleasantly surprised by the high level of student participation, given the large class size and the class being virtual, and he believes it was a big reason why the class was such a success.</p>\n<p>“There were more than 2,000 people that I’ve never met before, so I thought it was amazing that there was so much engagement,” Guillén said. “People felt that this was an opportunity to debate things with their friends, with other people, not just inside the class but outside, and it created a public sphere to discuss the issues.</p>\n<p>Though the course was designated as a part of Wharton's curriculum, its subject matter was interdisciplinary. Lecture topics included behavioral concepts, such as emotional contagion and leadership in uncertain times, as well as the pandemic's economic impact on global markets and supply chains.</p>\n<p>Guest lecturers included <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/penn-amy-gutmann-coronavirus-wharton-lecture\" target=\"_blank\">Penn President Amy Gutmann</a>, National Bureau of Economic Research Fellow Kent Smetters, and Wharton Dean Geoffrey Garrett, among others.</p>\n<p>Several students praised the breadth of topics discussed during the semester. Liza Ach, a rising second-year student in the accelerated Bachelor's of Science in Nursing program, saw the course as a unique opportunity to diversify her intense focus from the nursing education.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We tend to get kind of locked in to the nursing school, and obviously it’s because it's an accelerated program, so it was really great to have an interdisciplinary class and to be able to bring applied nursing knowledge to a class that was based at Wharton.”&nbsp;</p>\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"0a7d7939-a9bb-4d78-9eff-9682a868a127\" data-uuid=\"0a7d7939-a9bb-4d78-9eff-9682a868a127\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/78bb2b6a-134b-49d8-9818-feafd51de251.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"855.375\" data-height=\"570.09375\" data-align=\"\" />\n<p>In addition to the material that was taught, Ach and rising Engineering sophomore Sharon Kuo both said one of the largest reasons they decided to enroll in the class was because they were able to learn about something that was applicable to current events.</p>\n<p>“The pandemic is probably the biggest thing that I’ve lived through in my lifetime,” Kuo said. “It seemed like something that I really wanted to understand, and I knew it was going to reshape the world.”</p>\n<p>2020 Wharton MBA graduate Sadia Dhorat also cited the timeliness of the course as a reason for enrolling, adding that she felt it was risky to solely rely upon the news as her primary source of information. She said the course enabled her to both develop a more thorough understanding of the pandemic, and inform her family in South Africa about specific ideas she learned from it.</p>\n<p>Dhorat said that while the class was very interesting and useful, it was sometimes difficult to concentrate for the entirety of the three-hour lectures, especially since they were online.</p>\n<p>“I think the challenges, which I’m sure were faced by many, were just: 'How do you maintain your focus for three hours? How do you stay as engaged when you’re staring at your screen for three hours once a week, and how do you make sure that you absorb everything that you can?'\"</p>\n<p>The University has yet to make a final decision regarding the format of the fall semester. Regardless of the decision, Guillén said he thinks similarly large, online courses should be offered in the future – even when students are on campus.</p>\n<p>“For me, the biggest potential implication of this is that this is not just something that we had to do because we couldn’t be on campus,” Guillén said. “We can actually use this model in the future for bringing people together across campus. We don’t need an emergency.”</p>\n<p>Garrett echoed Guillén, and said the fact no lecture hall on Penn's campus, even Irvine Auditorium which has a maximum capacity of 1,260, could fit everyone that took the course in the same space made it such a unique experience.</p>\n<p>The live lectures took place on videoconferencing platform BlueJeans every Wednesday from 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. EDT. While the thousands of students could not speak during the lectures, they were able to interact with the professor in real time by submitting questions through the platform's question-and-answer feature.</p>\n<p>For students who were unable to attend the live classes, lectures were recorded and available the next day. Outside of class, students were required to post a brief comment in a Canvas discussion thread each week, and complete a weekly quiz based on a selection of assigned<strong> </strong>readings.</p>\n<p>While Garrett and Guillén were in favor of similar courses being offered in the future, both said they don’t believe an online education can replace in-person learning. Garrett realizes, however, that online courses offer some unique possibilities.</p>\n<p>“While we all cherish, and we should [cherish], face-to-face, on-campus [instruction], you can just use technology to do things that are literally unachievable on campus.”</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/penn-amy-gutmann-coronavirus-wharton-lecture\">Gutmann criticizes U.S. for ‘striking lack’ of global leadership during coronavirus course</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/penn-wharton-online-course-coronavirus\">Wharton introduces six-week online course on coronavirus and global crisis management</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"c19d5fa6d3","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"75736","created_at":"2020-05-25 01:42:31","modified_at":"2020-05-26 06:06:36","published_at":"2020-05-26 04:53:31","metadata":[],"hits":"26","normalized_tags":"|105|132|27|10614|15945|15948|","ceo_id":"189484","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"105","uuid":"42eb955e-db56-4cba-a412-4a5b763e9d19","name":"academics","slug":"academics","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"5"},{"id":"132","uuid":"9b693701-241e-45f3-a430-018489cdba1a","name":"top","slug":"top","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"41"},{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"10614","uuid":"e24ffc3d-b37c-471f-92bc-3878acbe55b9","name":"beats","slug":"beats","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"6592"},{"id":"15945","uuid":"7c59a448-2243-46a7-bad1-42263e5ce726","name":"latest-covid","slug":"latest-covid","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"16831"},{"id":"15948","uuid":"46c6dfbb-0026-42e7-84a7-b8a6e05e9015","name":"covid","slug":"covid","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"16835"}],"authors":[{"id":"8","uuid":"b3f956f3-aa56-41d5-81cf-bd63d2c8d45d","name":"Chase Sutton","email":"","slug":"chase-sutton","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"305","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"75736","uuid":"0a815c31-e758-4115-b4bd-db90cb445f6a","attachment_uuid":"bffb226b-c3b4-4cc2-9247-29e083d78c33","base_name":"wharton-coronavirus-class-mauro-guillen-geoffrey-garrett-final","seo_title":null,"seo_description":null,"seo_image":null,"extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Wharton Coronavirus Class Mauro Guillen Geoffrey Garrett Final.jpg","content":"<p>Professor Mauro Guillén spoke with guest lecturer and Wharton Dean Geoffrey Garrett on April 29, the final session of the course.</p>","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"4000","width":"6000","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-05-26 03:02:43","modified_at":"2020-05-26 03:29:35","published_at":"2020-05-26 03:02:50","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"189527","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"transcoded":"0"}},{"id":"87566","uuid":"2322e9e8-9b0b-4599-b685-398da07e0403","slug":"reverend-al-sharpton-letter-amy-gutmann-endowment-diversity","seo_title":null,"seo_description":null,"seo_image":null,"headline":"Rev.

The office of Cornell’s president shared the letter with the investment committee of the Cornell Board of Trustees.</p>\n<p>Sharpton and Raben, however, want each university to issue reports similar to that <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d35efa6690f4000010e09f2/t/5e5ec12f223e402cf6eb36fa/1583268146509/UC-CIO+Diversity+Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">issued</a> by the University of California’s Chief Investment Office in December 2019, which Sharpton mentioned in his letter to Gutmann.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Raben said the University of California's report is \"the gold standard\" for how universities should respond to Sharpton's letter, as it describes the racial and gender diversity of the University's own investment team. It also describes how many of the investment office’s partner firms are owned by women and people of color.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once universities have publicly released demographic information about their endowments, Raben said they should acknowledge areas where they can improve and vet minorities for jobs in asset management “in the same vetting process that [they] had white people in for a hundred years.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We’re not asking for charity, we’re asking for an equal playing field to compete,” Sharpton said. “If a woman-owned or minority-owned firm can show us they do a better return on investment, it is our fiduciary responsibility to show the trustees we are going with the best return.”&nbsp;</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/05/penn-endowment-graduate-students-coronavirus\">Over 200 profs. sign letter demanding U. use endowment to protect grad students</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/09/penn-endowment-return-decline-university-philadelphia\">Penn reports endowment return rate as 6.5% – a drop from 12.9% last year</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"ad3bc21fe7","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"75701","created_at":"2020-05-24 22:22:16","modified_at":"2020-05-25 06:02:08","published_at":"2020-05-25 05:50:17","metadata":[],"hits":"862","normalized_tags":"|132|27|17|139|10614|","ceo_id":"189476","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"132","uuid":"9b693701-241e-45f3-a430-018489cdba1a","name":"top","slug":"top","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"41"},{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"17","uuid":"45371b08-72b4-47ed-912d-837846a4b298","name":"administration","slug":"administration","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"126"},{"id":"139","uuid":"77f51539-edc1-47de-aec4-a6a107d43536","name":"gender-diversity","slug":"gender-diversity","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"178"},{"id":"10614","uuid":"e24ffc3d-b37c-471f-92bc-3878acbe55b9","name":"beats","slug":"beats","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"6592"}],"authors":[{"id":"7495","uuid":"402c6bdc-740b-4001-b95c-ac48ea4b5cff","name":"Bala Thenappan","email":"","slug":"bala-thenappan","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"8147","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"75701","uuid":"695c3a10-35e9-4988-9e91-62fcd83479d9","attachment_uuid":"4a774b39-f49d-4c0a-9c31-9abc450ed0cf","base_name":"al-sharpton","seo_title":null,"seo_description":null,"seo_image":null,"extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Al Sharpton.jpg","content":"Activist Reverend Al Sharpton is president of National Action Network, which is calling for universities to be more transparent in the demographic data of their asset managers.
