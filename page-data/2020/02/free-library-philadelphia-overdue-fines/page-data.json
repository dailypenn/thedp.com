The library system also decided to eliminate any current outstanding fees, which is expected to bring back the 88,000 library patrons who could not check out new items because of unpaid fines, according to the Inquirer.</p>\n<p>Those who have overdue items will receive reminders to return their books and will not be permitted to check out more items until their overdue items are returned, the Inquirer reported. After 30 days, the items will be considered lost and the patrons will be required to pay for them before they can check out more.</p>\n<p>Despite having <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2012/03/public_library_underused_by_penn_students\" target=\"_blank\">over 50 branches </a>across Philadelphia – the highest branch per capita among major U.S. cities – Philadelphia public libraries are among the most under-used in the country, but the West Philadelphia branch's managers said the library is well-used in the community. Despite its proximity to Penn’s campus, the West Philadelphia branch is not a hotspot among Penn students.</p>\n<p>The decision to eliminate late fines may cost the Free Library of Philadelphia nearly $424,000 in annual revenue, the Inquirer reported. Other city libraries that have implemented a fine-free policy, such as the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamrowe1/2019/11/03/chicago-libraries-late-fee-elimination-sparks-a-240-boost-in-book-returns/#184eb747457b\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago Public Library System</a>, saw increases in library visits, library card sign-ups, and book returns. Philadelphia's library board is anticipating similar results for the Philadelphia library system, according to the Inquirer.</p>\n<p>The Free Library of Philadelphia is one of the largest library systems in the nation to eliminate overdue fines.</p>\n<p>According to the Inquirer, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney backed a resolution to eliminate library fees last fall, calling the fines a \"punitive practice.\"</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED LINKS:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2012/03/public_library_underused_by_penn_students\">Free Library at 40th, Walnut a hub for West Philadelphia</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/02/penn-first-generation-low-income-textbook-library-greenfield-intercultural\">Students say FGLI textbook library needs more staff and resources</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/10/penn-libraries-manuscript-exhibit-south-asia\">New Van Pelt Library exhibit highlights aesthetics of Indian manuscripts</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"0ca2279da4","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"74605","created_at":"2020-02-19 20:54:41","modified_at":"2020-02-22 02:36:13","published_at":"2020-02-22 02:36:12","metadata":[{"label":"socialheadline","value":""}],"hits":"213","normalized_tags":"|27|118|15919|","ceo_id":"187855","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"118","uuid":"f201d73a-6832-4beb-b7f0-14b33aaf9199","name":"front","slug":"front","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"109"},{"id":"15919","uuid":"d817347b-962b-4316-83c2-f9929cb3c139","name":"real-time","slug":"real-time","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"16799"}],"authors":[{"id":"7439","uuid":"1909415c-12ba-4055-b8a0-700ff278f7b0","name":"Shirali Shah","email":"shiralis@wharton.upenn.edu","slug":"shirali-shah","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"8059","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"74605","uuid":"4560331e-4967-4d1c-ad62-c8d47c1f7a50","attachment_uuid":"c298288e-5b25-48aa-9577-f7bb283a43cc","base_name":"free-library-of-philadelphia","extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Free Library of Philadelphia.jpg","content":"Despite its close proximity, few Penn students visit the Free Library location at 40th and Walnut Street.","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"3569","width":"5354","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-02-19 23:24:02","modified_at":"2020-02-19 23:27:51","published_at":"2020-02-19 23:27:51","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"187865","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null}},"mostReadDP":[{"gaTitle":"Fresh Grocer to shut down in March following four-year legal battle with Penn | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Fresh Grocer to shut down in March following four-year legal battle with Penn","path":"/article/2020/02/fresh-grocer-penn-shut-down-acme","authors":["Hawthorne Ripley"],"views":"27025","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/d6276c1a-2915-4645-90a0-53fc916c9eda.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"An Acme supermarket will officially replace The Fresh Grocer on 40th and Walnut streets | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"An Acme supermarket will officially replace The Fresh Grocer on 40th and Walnut streets","path":"/article/2020/02/fresh-grocer-acme-penn-lease","authors":["Hawthorne Ripley"],"views":"4122","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/6e8a5ccb-e486-4e1e-b810-cdbf7256672d.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Fresh Grocer&#8217;s imminent closure leaves students fearing inconvenience and uncertainty | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Fresh Grocer&#8217;s imminent closure leaves students fearing inconvenience and uncertainty","path":"/article/2020/02/fresh-grocer-acme-penn-closing-student-reactions","authors":["Hawthorne Ripley"],"views":"2454","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/0af9c5e5-3708-4063-a4ca-79999cca31df.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"SPEC returns Spring Fling to two-day format with concert on Friday night | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"SPEC returns Spring Fling to two-day format with concert on Friday night","path":"/article/2020/02/penn-spring-fling-spec-two-days","authors":["Elizabeth Meisenzahl"],"views":"2418","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/11a6ae56-fe5d-4280-bef2-eafafde4229e.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Editorial | Penn and West Phila. deserve more details on Fresh Grocer&#8217;s closing | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Editorial | Penn and West Phila. deserve more details on Fresh Grocer&#8217;s closing","path":"/article/2020/02/fresh-grocer-upenn-grocery-stores-philadelphia","authors":["The Daily Pennsylvanian Editorial Board"],"views":"2410","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/d67e28dc-17bc-42ab-9241-ccba17931bbd.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"}]}}}
