Despite Sanders’ wins in early states, Gym is just the second elected official in Pennsylvania to endorse Sanders, according to the Inquirer. Representative Sara Innamorato, who represents parts of Pittsburgh, endorsed Sanders last year.</p>\n<p>Gym co-authored an <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/hahnemann-university-hospital-bernie-sanders-helen-gym-20190711.html\" target=\"_blank\">opinion piece </a>in the Inquirer with Sanders last summer to protest the <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/bernie-sanders-rally-philadelphia-hahnemann-hospital-closure-medicare-for-all-20190715.html\" target=\"_blank\">closure of Hahnemann University Hospital</a> due to bankruptcy. Sanders and Gym wrote in the opinion piece about his plans for a Medicare for All system that would guarantee coverage to all people.</p>\n<p>“We are going to invest in health-care facilities that operate in underserved areas, and we are going to end the culture of corporate greed that is denying health care to millions of people in the richest country on Earth,” Sanders and Gym wrote in the Inquirer.</p>\n<p>Gym told the Inquirer that fears among the Democratic Party about Sanders are unwarranted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I see it as, who is speaking to the needs of everyday Pennsylvanians?” Gym told the Inquirer. “In a city where an oil refinery exploded on national TV, leaving us with contaminated neighborhoods and lost jobs, this is not an abstract thing. His agenda for housing, for debt-free college, for clean air and water and health care for all and strong public schools, is in no way a left agenda. It’s what the Democratic Party used to be, and it’s time to take it back.”</p>\n<p>Gym originally <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2015/10/alum-helen-gym-on-education-and-housing-reform\" target=\"_blank\">ran</a> in 2015 for the Philadelphia Council at-large on a platform of education and housing reform. As an activist-turned-lawmaker, Gym told the Inquirer that Sanders’ connection to grassroots mobilization also inspired her to endorse him.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen movements reshape our city and state, and I believe in the power of movements to reshape our country. Bernie Sanders doesn’t just talk about movements for change. He leads them,” Gym told the Inquirer.&nbsp;</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED: </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/12/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-upenn-ivy-league\">How Warren and Sanders' battle for progressives is playing out on Penn's campus</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/02/new-hampshire-primary-pete-buttigieg-bernie-sanders-election-democrat\">Bernie's 'momentum' vs. Buttigieg's 'movement': Youth voters sound off at competing rallies</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"8d9859f662","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"74772","created_at":"2020-02-27 17:42:15","modified_at":"2020-02-28 00:44:08","published_at":"2020-02-28 00:44:07","metadata":[],"hits":"96","normalized_tags":"|27|118|42|15919|","ceo_id":"188100","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"118","uuid":"f201d73a-6832-4beb-b7f0-14b33aaf9199","name":"front","slug":"front","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"109"},{"id":"42","uuid":"6dfd1f48-470c-4185-9df5-d4652b4de435","name":"politics","slug":"politics","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"141"},{"id":"15919","uuid":"d817347b-962b-4316-83c2-f9929cb3c139","name":"real-time","slug":"real-time","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"16799"}],"authors":[{"id":"7318","uuid":"0c4b9c43-8444-4751-8026-f8a129fe39b6","name":"Jenna Pollack","email":"","slug":"jenna-pollack","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"7965","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"74772","uuid":"ced39846-7e20-47be-abed-215515ff8bdf","attachment_uuid":"75173246-c79b-466b-b81a-a37e923489d1","base_name":"helen-gym-bernie-sanders-endorsement","extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Helen Gym Bernie Sanders Endorsement.jpg","content":"","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"1920","width":"2880","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-02-28 00:16:45","modified_at":"2020-02-28 00:16:56","published_at":"2020-02-28 00:16:55","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"188116","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null}},"mostReadDP":[{"gaTitle":"Erika James, the dean of Emory&#39;s business school, will be the new Wharton School dean | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Erika James, the dean of Emory&#39;s business school, will be the new Wharton School dean","path":"/article/2020/02/wharton-dean-emory-goizueta-business-school-erika-james","authors":["Ashley Ahn"],"views":"6760","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/e4236e58-25b9-4565-9882-5b2bfe1cd33c.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn Athletics and men&#39;s basketball program receive NCAA sanctions for Jerome Allen scandal | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn Athletics and men&#39;s basketball program receive NCAA sanctions for Jerome Allen scandal","path":"/article/2020/02/penn-mens-basketball-jerome-allen-ncaa-sanctions-recruting-ivy-league","authors":["Michael Landau"],"views":"2382","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/fd454e10-85fe-4fdd-b2f4-dd893d41deef.sized-1000x1000.jpeg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn&#8217;s total cost of attendance will rise to &#36;76,826 next year, a 3.9&#37; increase | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn&#8217;s total cost of attendance will rise to &#36;76,826 next year, a 3.9&#37; increase","path":"/article/2020/02/penn-cost-of-attendance-tuition-increase-gutmann","authors":["Anya Tullman"],"views":"2321","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/4c0947e3-f90d-4699-94ae-66e7a41e3a66.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Harrison Selznick | Penn students should visit The Fresh Grocer before it closes | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Harrison Selznick | Penn students should visit The Fresh Grocer before it closes","path":"/article/2020/02/fresh-grocer-upenn-food-sales","authors":["Harrison Selznick"],"views":"1669","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/9d58d1e5-fea2-4190-bfed-ed1b76203ffa.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Agatha Advincula | Voters should be wary of Bernie Sanders.
