Jimmy John's has three restaurants around Penn's campus, none of which were mentioned in the letter.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-brief/fda-brief-fda-issues-warning-letters-jimmy-johns-and-sprout-distributor-food-safety-violations\" target=\"_blank\">news release</a> Tuesday, FDA Deputy Commissioner Frank Yiannas said, “Jimmy John's has not demonstrated implementation of long-term sustainable corrections to its supply chain to assure the safety of ingredients used in its products.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The FDA letter said Jimmy John's has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/25/health/jimmy-johns-fda-warning-letter/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">15 days to respond </a>with the specific measures the chain is taking to address the violation.</p>\n<p>Following the FDA letter, Jimmy John’s President James North ordered the removal of sprouts from all of the chain’s locations until further notice, CNN reported.</p>\n<p>\"Food safety is our top priority,” North told CNN. “This removal (of sprouts) was out of an abundance of caution and was not initiated by any known, immediate threat.”</p>\n<p>Jimmy John’s first <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2008/08/online_update_radian_will_also_house_chipotle_and_jimmy_johns_gourmet_sandwiches\" target=\"_blank\">opened</a> their location in the Radian building at 3025 Walnut Street in 2008. The location was opened by 2000 Wharton graduate Brett Weinheimer, who said he wanted to provide a good <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2012/11/local-jimmy-johns-owner-cant-get-enough-of-penn\" target=\"_blank\">late night food option</a> for Penn students.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since 2008, locations have opened at 3601 Market St. and 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, by the Penn Museum.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>None of the Jimmy John’s locations mentioned in the warning letter from the FDA are in the state of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>According to the FDA, E. coli can cause illnesses, including diarrhea, but most healthy adults can recover within a week. Salmonella, on the other hand, can cause serious, even life-threatening, infections.</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED: </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/10/penn-philadelphia-netter-center-food-justice-initiative-public-health\">Philadelphia Department of Public Health launches program to combat food inequity</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/01/chop-hospital-pharmacy-food-west-philadelphia-children-penn\">CHOP opens first food pharmacy for patient families in West Philadelphia</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"8b43b610b7","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"74741","created_at":"2020-02-26 21:57:26","modified_at":"2020-02-28 00:29:54","published_at":"2020-02-28 00:29:53","metadata":[],"hits":"131","normalized_tags":"|27|118|15919|","ceo_id":"188052","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"118","uuid":"f201d73a-6832-4beb-b7f0-14b33aaf9199","name":"front","slug":"front","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"109"},{"id":"15919","uuid":"d817347b-962b-4316-83c2-f9929cb3c139","name":"real-time","slug":"real-time","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"16799"}],"authors":[{"id":"7343","uuid":"5668824f-a2d6-4212-8115-322f1693a1cf","name":"Noah Lewine","email":"","slug":"noah-lewine","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"7973","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"74741","uuid":"b5cd2dd4-ef4b-43d5-96c0-b6e56b23c582","attachment_uuid":"1124d1b6-c0f8-4867-b7f9-6ce195b14fad","base_name":"jimmy-johns-001","extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Jimmy John's  001.jpg","content":"<p>Jimmy John's has 15 days to respond with the specific ways they will address the violation.</p>","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"3150","width":"4725","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-02-27 00:27:07","modified_at":"2020-02-27 01:22:44","published_at":"2020-02-27 00:27:23","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"188074","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null}},"mostReadDP":[{"gaTitle":"Erika James, the dean of Emory&#39;s business school, will be the new Wharton School dean | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Erika James, the dean of Emory&#39;s business school, will be the new Wharton School dean","path":"/article/2020/02/wharton-dean-emory-goizueta-business-school-erika-james","authors":["Ashley Ahn"],"views":"6760","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/e4236e58-25b9-4565-9882-5b2bfe1cd33c.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn Athletics and men&#39;s basketball program receive NCAA sanctions for Jerome Allen scandal | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn Athletics and men&#39;s basketball program receive NCAA sanctions for Jerome Allen scandal","path":"/article/2020/02/penn-mens-basketball-jerome-allen-ncaa-sanctions-recruting-ivy-league","authors":["Michael Landau"],"views":"2382","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/fd454e10-85fe-4fdd-b2f4-dd893d41deef.sized-1000x1000.jpeg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn&#8217;s total cost of attendance will rise to &#36;76,826 next year, a 3.9&#37; increase | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn&#8217;s total cost of attendance will rise to &#36;76,826 next year, a 3.9&#37; increase","path":"/article/2020/02/penn-cost-of-attendance-tuition-increase-gutmann","authors":["Anya Tullman"],"views":"2321","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/4c0947e3-f90d-4699-94ae-66e7a41e3a66.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Harrison Selznick | Penn students should visit The Fresh Grocer before it closes | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Harrison Selznick | Penn students should visit The Fresh Grocer before it closes","path":"/article/2020/02/fresh-grocer-upenn-food-sales","authors":["Harrison Selznick"],"views":"1669","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/9d58d1e5-fea2-4190-bfed-ed1b76203ffa.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Agatha Advincula | Voters should be wary of Bernie Sanders.
