Pressuring Penn to improve access to transportation services and physical locations on campus is a future goal of the club, but DAP’s founders said they are focusing on community-building for this spring semester.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to just create a common space where anyone with any range of disabilities can just come in and talk about their experience at Penn, how it feels to be a student at Penn, working with [Student Disabilities Services] and how that feels, and how it feels when you’re out in classes, not with people with disabilities,\" College first-year and DAP co-founder Kruti Desai said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Desai and DAP co-founder and College junior Emma Ronzetti said the group hopes to create a Penn-themed survival guide before the upcoming fall semester to help students with disabilities in the incoming first-year class. The guide will help students navigate around campus and use resources such as <a href=\"https://www.vpul.upenn.edu/lrc/sds/\" target=\"_blank\">Student Disabilities Services</a> and &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vpul.upenn.edu/lrc/lr/\" target=\"_blank\">Weingarten Learning Resources Center</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Sometimes the process is so confusing that a [first-year] coming into campus is completely overwhelmed, so it would be really nice to have mentors to help them out,” said Ronzetti.</p>\n<p>Ronzetti and College junior and DAP co-founder Elizabeth Kim said that they came up with the idea for DAP after discussing the lack of community among Penn students with disabilities. Kim said she gained a valuable sense of belonging while interning with the <a href=\"https://www.limeconnect.com/programs/page/the-lime-connect-fellowship-program\" target=\"_blank\">Lime Connect Fellowship Program for Students with Disabilities</a> last summer, a feeling she said she lacked after returning to Penn.&nbsp;</p>\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"f1836546-72ad-42ed-bf0d-d6b906535180\" data-uuid=\"f1836546-72ad-42ed-bf0d-d6b906535180\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/be9c1e77-c502-4482-83ae-76cdc36acfca.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"0\" data-height=\"0\" data-align=\"\" />\n<p>Kim said becoming close with other members of the disability community was a life-changing experience for her.</p>\n<p>“I feel like Penn lacks a community because there are a lot of people with disabilities, but many are scared to admit that they have one, which I completely understand, because there’s a stigma around having one,” said Kim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ronzetti, a former sports reporter for The Daily Pennsylvanian, said 30 to 40 students attended the first two DAP meetings.</p>\n<p>Desai and Ronzetti said Penn creates additional burdens for students with disabilities because they said there is an inadequate standardized process for students to receive accommodations<strong> </strong>from the University.</p>\n<p>Ronzetti said receiving accommodations from the University is a \"very individual, isolated, [and] alone process.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“My hearing disability hasn’t changed from the spring to fall semester, but I need to figure out my accommodations with my advisor every single semester,” Ronzetti said.</p>\n<p>Desai said there is a lack of common absence policies for students with physical or cognitive disabilities. She added that <a href=\"https://cms.business-services.upenn.edu/transportation/schedules/penn-accessible-transit.html\" target=\"_blank\">Penn’s Accessible Transit system</a> for students with physical disabilities is unreliable.</p>\n<p>“Most of the time the vans do not come, and we end up having to walk to classes,” Desai said.</p>\n<p>Ronzetti also said the ARCH Building, <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/11/penn-cultural-houses-arch-basement-curf\" target=\"_blank\">home to the 6B Coalition</a>, is difficult to access for students with physical disabilities. She added that DAP has had discussions with members of the 6B who are pushing to have the building redone.</p>\n<p>Kim said a long-term goal she wants DAP to pursue is to lobby for Penn to open a physical space on campus for students with disabilities.</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/02/penn-chabad-disability-inclusion-mental-health-awareness-shabbat\">Penn Chabad joins hundreds of communities worldwide in disability inclusion Shabbat dinner</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/12/tutoring-center-weingarten-learning-penn-academics\">Tutoring center merges with Weingarten to help centralize learning resource information</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"55f4b4c9e7","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"74675","created_at":"2020-02-23 23:07:11","modified_at":"2020-02-24 03:11:50","published_at":"2020-02-24 03:00:08","metadata":[],"hits":"1288","normalized_tags":"|27|118|15920|","ceo_id":"187963","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"118","uuid":"f201d73a-6832-4beb-b7f0-14b33aaf9199","name":"front","slug":"front","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"109"},{"id":"15920","uuid":"6c97c988-ba11-4171-b92a-f4309c24edb6","name":"general-assignment","slug":"general-assignment","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"16800"}],"authors":[{"id":"7307","uuid":"fa62d805-29a8-4084-bab0-af0749f148a5","name":"Rebecca DeMarre","email":"","slug":"rebecca-demarre","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"7943","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"74675","uuid":"b84c933f-42c2-43cb-9919-eb70b5115131","attachment_uuid":"45e8d7ea-61d5-4ab0-a26c-214ef6e44c51","base_name":"student-disabilities-club","extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Student Disabilities Club","content":"<p>Elizabeth Kim (left), Kruti Desai (middle), and Emma Ronzetti (right) are co-founders of Disability Advocacy @ Penn.&nbsp;</p>","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"1200","width":"1800","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-02-24 00:11:39","modified_at":"2020-02-24 00:51:10","published_at":"2020-02-24 00:12:05","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"187974","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null}},"mostReadDP":[{"gaTitle":"Erika H.
