It's a venue and a hub for global policy engagement.\"</p>\n<p>“To lead Perry World House, we searched for an accomplished scholar in the study of global and international issues,” Gutmann told Penn Today. “We also sought someone with a distinct vision for global policy and a robust network of global academics and policy makers to help see that vision through to implementation. In Mike, we get both.”</p>\n<p>Pritchett told Penn Today that Horowitz is the ideal leader to chart the future of PWH.</p>\n<p>“He has been central to its mission from the beginning, galvanizing dialogue and research to address the most critical global challenges,\" Pritchett said.</p>\n<p>Horowitz earned his bachelor's degree in political science from Emory University in 2000 and his Ph.D. in government from Harvard University in 2007.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2015, <a href=\"https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse/about-perry-world-house\" target=\"_blank\">PWH</a> is a center for international exchange and public outreach on pressing global issues that aims to foster international policy engagement within the Penn community.</p>\n<p>\"I'm excited to have this opportunity to continue building Perry World House and making it a place that is welcoming and inclusive for the Penn community,\" Horowitz said.</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/10/perry-world-house-renovating-democracy\">At Perry World House event, authors discuss adapting democracy to 21st century challenges</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/02/perry-world-house-upenn-carnegie-grant-policy-philadelphia\">Perry World House offers $10,000 grants for faculty to make more courses 'policy relevant'</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"0e01be9b25","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"74711","created_at":"2020-02-25 19:35:21","modified_at":"2020-02-27 05:47:57","published_at":"2020-02-26 03:41:23","metadata":[],"hits":"339","normalized_tags":"|27|118|17|10614|","ceo_id":"188016","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"118","uuid":"f201d73a-6832-4beb-b7f0-14b33aaf9199","name":"front","slug":"front","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"109"},{"id":"17","uuid":"45371b08-72b4-47ed-912d-837846a4b298","name":"administration","slug":"administration","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"126"},{"id":"10614","uuid":"e24ffc3d-b37c-471f-92bc-3878acbe55b9","name":"beats","slug":"beats","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"6592"}],"authors":[{"id":"7322","uuid":"18080f3f-b0a5-44f8-b073-4437b107fd47","name":"Amjad Hamza","email":"","slug":"amjad-hamza","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"7956","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"74711","uuid":"9dbe582f-03e5-4ac5-a53f-c142e23f1a63","attachment_uuid":"c2465305-36ad-44cf-9f6f-4255d99cb572","base_name":"michael-horowitz-pwh-director","extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Michael Horowitz PWH Director.jpg","content":"Horowitz has served as interim director of PWH since July 2019 .","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"2576","width":"3861","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-02-25 20:22:58","modified_at":"2020-02-25 20:23:36","published_at":"2020-02-25 20:23:35","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"188020","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null}},"mostReadDP":[{"gaTitle":"Erika James, the dean of Emory&#39;s business school, will be the new Wharton School dean | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Erika James, the dean of Emory&#39;s business school, will be the new Wharton School dean","path":"/article/2020/02/wharton-dean-emory-goizueta-business-school-erika-james","authors":["Ashley Ahn"],"views":"6760","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/e4236e58-25b9-4565-9882-5b2bfe1cd33c.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn Athletics and men&#39;s basketball program receive NCAA sanctions for Jerome Allen scandal | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn Athletics and men&#39;s basketball program receive NCAA sanctions for Jerome Allen scandal","path":"/article/2020/02/penn-mens-basketball-jerome-allen-ncaa-sanctions-recruting-ivy-league","authors":["Michael Landau"],"views":"2382","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/fd454e10-85fe-4fdd-b2f4-dd893d41deef.sized-1000x1000.jpeg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn&#8217;s total cost of attendance will rise to &#36;76,826 next year, a 3.9&#37; increase | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn&#8217;s total cost of attendance will rise to &#36;76,826 next year, a 3.9&#37; increase","path":"/article/2020/02/penn-cost-of-attendance-tuition-increase-gutmann","authors":["Anya Tullman"],"views":"2321","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/4c0947e3-f90d-4699-94ae-66e7a41e3a66.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Harrison Selznick | Penn students should visit The Fresh Grocer before it closes | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Harrison Selznick | Penn students should visit The Fresh Grocer before it closes","path":"/article/2020/02/fresh-grocer-upenn-food-sales","authors":["Harrison Selznick"],"views":"1669","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/9d58d1e5-fea2-4190-bfed-ed1b76203ffa.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Agatha Advincula | Voters should be wary of Bernie Sanders.
