This has caused the displacement of many former residents, with the area’s Black population declining by more than half, according to WHYY.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>State Senator Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia) introduced the proposal, outlining the four components of his plan in late January. He confirmed in an email to The Daily Pennsylvanian that he hopes to introduce a bill sometime in the near future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vincent Reina, a professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning, believes that investment in affordable housing in Philadelphia is vital given the aging and decrepit condition of properties currently available. Reina believes that the recent attention paid to affordable housing comes as a result of the situation reaching a breaking point for many people in the city.</p>\n<p>“I think people have become increasingly aware of the importance of housing, and in many ways this is reflective of the fact that we haven't<strong> </strong>done something for a while,” Reina said. “So it’s like we got to crisis point, and it’s usually at that crisis point where everyone says ‘Oh, we need to act.’”</p>\n<p>Reina also said Penn students living off-campus have contributed indirectly to decreasing housing affordability in West Philadelphia and the city generally. He explained that the willingness many students have to pay more for housing and the increase in demand they contribute has driven up rent, forcing many lower-income individuals to struggle.</p>\n<p>Hughes, <a href=\"\" target=\"_self\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/senate_bio.cfm?id=152\" target=\"_blank\">graduate</a> of Temple University, believes that housing is a crucial issue in Philadelphia, especially given the city’s abnormally high poverty rate. Philadelphia is often named the poorest of the nation's major cities, according to <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/poverty-still-plaguing-philadelphia-poorest-big-city-in-the-country/\" target=\"_blank\">WHYY</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Everyone needs a place to live and housing is generally the largest expense individuals and families carry,” said Hughes. “Having access to safe, affordable housing is critical and it is our job as legislators to make that attainable.”</p>\n<p>This effort comes on the heels of the <a href=\"https://www.phila.gov/FairHousingCommission/Pages/GoodCause.aspx#:~:text=The%20law%20prevents%20an%20owner,such%20as%20month%20to%20month.\" target=\"_blank\">Good Cause eviction law</a>, which was signed into law in April 2019 and prevents Philadelphia landlords from evicting tenants without presenting a reason for doing so. However, Philadelphia Tenants Union volunteer Nicholas Krapf believes that much stronger legislation is needed.</p>\n<p>Though he believes that there’s still much to be done to improve Philadelphia’s housing system, Krapf expressed hope that the public is becoming more accepting of the importance of affordable housing in the city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Having a place to live and rest, I think, on an emotional level, and having a place to do work and raise a family — if you don’t have a place to go where you feel safe, it affects other parts of your life,” said Krapf.</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/01/arvilla-gentrification-affordable-housing-west-philadelphia\">City Hall meeting confronts gentrification after West Phila. apartment put up for sale</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/10/penn-university-city-luxury-apartments-housing-guide\">Off-campus luxury apartments offer comfort to Penn students at a steep price</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"d70f400158","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"74728","created_at":"2020-02-27 00:05:25","modified_at":"2020-02-27 19:24:25","published_at":"2020-02-27 03:42:39","metadata":[],"hits":"243","normalized_tags":"|27|118|170|10614|","ceo_id":"188071","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"118","uuid":"f201d73a-6832-4beb-b7f0-14b33aaf9199","name":"front","slug":"front","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"109"},{"id":"170","uuid":"357404fc-011e-414a-825c-7945445a1530","name":"west-philly","slug":"west-philly","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"183"},{"id":"10614","uuid":"e24ffc3d-b37c-471f-92bc-3878acbe55b9","name":"beats","slug":"beats","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"6592"}],"authors":[{"id":"7329","uuid":"7c0ad39d-e150-425e-b345-2863909e1688","name":"Katie Busch","email":"","slug":"katie-busch","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"7966","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"74728","uuid":"e92213a1-27bd-4787-9b03-250d93012f6c","attachment_uuid":"fd5d9275-398b-49e5-830c-ef48da726013","base_name":"img-3412","extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"New Housing West Philly Apartments.jpg","content":"<p>The average price of a home in University City has skyrocketed in recent years, causing the displacement of many former residents.</p>","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"2605","width":"3907","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-02-26 22:34:40","modified_at":"2020-02-27 20:02:51","published_at":"2020-02-26 22:35:25","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"188055","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null}},"mostReadDP":[{"gaTitle":"Erika James, the dean of Emory&#39;s business school, will be the new Wharton School dean | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Erika James, the dean of Emory&#39;s business school, will be the new Wharton School dean","path":"/article/2020/02/wharton-dean-emory-goizueta-business-school-erika-james","authors":["Ashley Ahn"],"views":"6760","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/e4236e58-25b9-4565-9882-5b2bfe1cd33c.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn Athletics and men&#39;s basketball program receive NCAA sanctions for Jerome Allen scandal | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn Athletics and men&#39;s basketball program receive NCAA sanctions for Jerome Allen scandal","path":"/article/2020/02/penn-mens-basketball-jerome-allen-ncaa-sanctions-recruting-ivy-league","authors":["Michael Landau"],"views":"2382","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/fd454e10-85fe-4fdd-b2f4-dd893d41deef.sized-1000x1000.jpeg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn&#8217;s total cost of attendance will rise to &#36;76,826 next year, a 3.9&#37; increase | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn&#8217;s total cost of attendance will rise to &#36;76,826 next year, a 3.9&#37; increase","path":"/article/2020/02/penn-cost-of-attendance-tuition-increase-gutmann","authors":["Anya Tullman"],"views":"2321","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/4c0947e3-f90d-4699-94ae-66e7a41e3a66.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Harrison Selznick | Penn students should visit The Fresh Grocer before it closes | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Harrison Selznick | Penn students should visit The Fresh Grocer before it closes","path":"/article/2020/02/fresh-grocer-upenn-food-sales","authors":["Harrison Selznick"],"views":"1669","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/9d58d1e5-fea2-4190-bfed-ed1b76203ffa.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Agatha Advincula | Voters should be wary of Bernie Sanders.
