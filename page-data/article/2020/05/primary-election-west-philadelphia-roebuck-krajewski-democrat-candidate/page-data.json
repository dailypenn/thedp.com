It’s not just about education anymore.”</p>\n<p>Dunn said she will prioritize implementing the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/14/politics/green-new-deal-proposal-breakdown/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Green New Deal</a>, a set of policies to address climate change, at the local and state level if she is elected as State Representative.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t get something straight about our environment, that affects everything,” Dunn said. “That affects housing, that affects education, that affects the living wage.”</p>\n<p>Dunn also<strong> </strong>said she thinks<strong> </strong>the state has responded well to the coronavirus<strong> </strong>pandemic by aiding people currently facing unemployment, however, she believes more can be done to protect renters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We need legislation to truly hold back the terror that will come to renters through evictions and being told they are responsible for months of rent all at one time,” Dunn said. “I’ve seen the city pass legislation on paying workers during the pandemic but not really advocating for citizens or workers who rent.”</p>\n<p><strong>Greg Benjamin</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.greg4philly.com/policy-update\" target=\"_blank\">Greg Benjamin</a> is the leader of the 51st ward of Philadelphia and has a long history of pushing <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gregforphilly/\" target=\"_blank\">efforts</a> that support local libraries and<strong> </strong>community centers, as well as volunteering as a Christian minister.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Benjamin said the next Pennsylvania<strong> </strong>state representative must do more to address <a href=\"https://www.greg4philly.com/policy-update\" target=\"_blank\">mental health issues</a>, which he said manifest themselves in areas of<strong> </strong>education, housing, and criminal justice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“There are limited resources to help [people with mental health issues] with getting services and just having a safe place to live,” he said. “And of course if you know anything about the criminal justice system, you know that mental health is another significant problem in the criminal justice system.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Benjamin said he has engaged in significant community outreach during the pandemic by<strong> </strong>organizing efforts to feed and provide mental health services for underprivileged people in the Philadelphia community, adding that the office of the incumbent, Roebuck, has been “inaccessible” during the coronavirus outbreak.</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/05/pennsylvania-primary-mail-in-absentee-ballot-deadline-application\">The Pa. mail-in ballot application deadline is May 26.
