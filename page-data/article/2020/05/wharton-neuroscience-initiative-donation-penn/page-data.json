He also hopes to add more courses on the subject of neuroeconomics to the current Wharton curriculum.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Platt said WiN has been running on a \"start-up budget,\" funded by the Wharton School, Platt’s personal labs, and philanthropic gifts from alumni and friends of Wharton. The new donation will allow WiN to \"turbocharge\" their current progress, he said.</p>\n<p>WiN was <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2017/03/wharton-neuroscience-initiative\" target=\"_blank\">launched</a> in September 2016 by Platt and Senior Fellow Elizabeth Johnson to stimulate interdisciplinary work at the intersection of neuroscience and business.</p>\n<p>In its nearly four year history, WiN has worked closely with the Wharton Behavioral Lab and other on-campus research labs, but will now look to purchase new equipment to promote individual study.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“A lot of the work we do requires specialized technology, especially wearable brain monitoring devices, which I think are going to be increasingly important as we try to push neuroscience out of the lab and into the world of business environments and consumer environments,\" Platt said.</p>\n<p>In the future, the Initiative is looking to reframe how companies approach a variety of challenges including brand strategy, customer experience, talent assessment, and business decision-making, according to a <a href=\"https://news.wharton.upenn.edu/press-releases/2020/05/leadership-gift-to-accelerate-neuroscience-at-wharton-and-create-actionable-insights-in-brain-science-and-business/\" target=\"_blank\">Wharton press release</a>.</p>\n<p>The funding will support collaborative research teams among students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty to work on research projects and increase collaboration with partners outside the University, including government agencies and nonprofit organizations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Platt and Johnson had previously founded the Center for Neuroeconomic Studies at Duke University. Platt said they both<strong> </strong>left Duke for Wharton when he became interested in the intersection of neuropsychology and business analytics.</p>\n<p>“This is the promise and potential of Wharton and Penn that originally drove me to join this team.”</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/penn-wharton-quantitative-finance-mba-major\">Wharton will offer quantitative finance major for MBA students starting this fall</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/penn-wharton-mba-ranking-stanford\">Wharton ties Stanford for best MBA program in 2021 U.S. News &amp; World Report ranking</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"160b7b59c3","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"75671","created_at":"2020-05-22 03:39:33","modified_at":"2020-05-23 16:48:08","published_at":"2020-05-23 16:43:36","metadata":[],"hits":"333","normalized_tags":"|27|118|145|15919|","ceo_id":"189428","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"118","uuid":"f201d73a-6832-4beb-b7f0-14b33aaf9199","name":"front","slug":"front","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"109"},{"id":"145","uuid":"65e00a2c-8b64-4a73-9531-9dbdb5206c1c","name":"wharton","slug":"wharton","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"215"},{"id":"15919","uuid":"d817347b-962b-4316-83c2-f9929cb3c139","name":"real-time","slug":"real-time","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"16799"}],"authors":[{"id":"7494","uuid":"bac3c53c-c371-4f96-8a67-9c38c1cc2893","name":"William Gallagher","email":"","slug":"william-gallagher","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"8138","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"75671","uuid":"a2750088-e9c3-448b-b657-0808066f7c9c","attachment_uuid":"21bbbbf4-18ac-4a62-9bf6-6900558427c8","base_name":"huntsman-hall-wharton","seo_title":null,"seo_description":null,"seo_image":null,"extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Huntsman Hall Wharton.jpg","content":"WiN will use part of the $10 million-dollar donation to purchase new equipment for performing research.","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"3321","width":"4982","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-05-22 04:06:49","modified_at":"2020-05-22 04:09:29","published_at":"2020-05-22 04:09:29","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"189430","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"transcoded":"0"}},"mostReadDP":[{"gaTitle":"Penn outlines four possible scenarios for fall 2020, will finalize plan by end of June | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn outlines four possible scenarios for fall 2020, will finalize plan by end of June","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-update-fall-2020-covid-plan-coronavirus","authors":["Jonah Charlton","Pia Singh"],"views":"23648","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/56cc0847-1de8-46e5-9433-3d0ed01be26f.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Here&#8217;s how Ivy League universities are changing testing requirements for the Class of 2025 | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Here&#8217;s how Ivy League universities are changing testing requirements for the Class of 2025","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-admissions-testing-ivy-league","authors":["Pia Singh"],"views":"8269","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/15d3ef48-48ac-47c4-92ff-2175237b6190.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn ranked eighth best U.S. university by Quacquarelli Symonds | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn ranked eighth best U.S. university by Quacquarelli Symonds","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-ranks-eight-qs-university-ranking","authors":["Serena Zhang"],"views":"7839","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/e3b2c1ef-d420-4b58-a7eb-70a30b2839f0.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Here&#8217;s how the Ivy League is planning for the fall semester | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Here&#8217;s how the Ivy League is planning for the fall semester","path":"/article/2020/04/penn-ivy-league-fall-semester-2020-coronavirus","authors":["Komal Patel"],"views":"7369","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/5bc8d4d2-5900-4ac5-9bba-54140fce3d1b.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Over 200 profs. sign letter demanding U. use endowment to protect grad students | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Over 200 profs. sign letter demanding U. use endowment to protect grad students","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-endowment-graduate-students-coronavirus","authors":["Anya Tullman"],"views":"4963","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/41e504e6-c562-42f3-a9bf-7f97bcbd7911.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"}]}}}
