So it's not cheaper; it's actually more expensive for the University to develop and deliver these courses.\"</p>\n<p>Rising Engineering sophomore Vishaal Kumar said he originally hoped Penn would reduce the cost of summer courses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"The [online] education just isn't the exact same [as in person],\" Kumar said. \"But I understand why the price cannot change.\"</p>\n<p>Kumar said he is taking MATH 240: Calculus III and PHYS 151: Principles of Physics II: Electromagnetism and Radiation this summer in an effort to complete requirements and advance in future coursework.</p>\n<p>He said the registration process for both classes \"went pretty smoothly,\" but added that he knew friends who had a difficult time getting into the classes they wanted to take.</p>\n<p>Rising College junior Emilie Dávila had a different experience while registering for summer classes, describing it as both \"frustrating and confusing.\"</p>\n<p>Dávila said she wanted to take CHEM 242: Organic Chemistry II ⁠— a requirement for applying to medical school ⁠— during Summer Session II, but has been unable to get into the class so far.</p>\n<p>\"It seems like a lot of people want to take this class,\" Dávila said. \"I know a lot of people, myself included, on the waitlist [to take the class,] who have emailed the LPS department multiple times and have been told the waitlist is very extensive.\"</p>\n<p>She said the class has been capped at 50 students since registration opened, and she is \"still waiting to see if they will increase the amount of seats.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know what to expect right now, and I just want to know what I'll be doing for the rest of the summer,\" she said.</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p>\n<p><a
