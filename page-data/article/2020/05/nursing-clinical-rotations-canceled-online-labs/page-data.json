State regulations mandate that in order<strong> </strong>to receive a license to practice, students must complete a certain number of clinical hours over their four years of study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After clinical placements were placed on hold, <a href=\"https://www.nursing.upenn.edu/live/blurbs/1471-a-message-to-penn-nursing-undergraduate-students\" target=\"_blank\">Nursing faculty worked</a> to find adequate online solutions to ensure all students could remain on track for requirements needed for<strong> </strong>graduation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All graduating seniors enrolled in <a href=\"https://catalog.upenn.edu/courses/nurs/\" target=\"_blank\">NURS 390 Leadership in the Complex Healthcare System</a> preceptorships were allowed to remediate their hours by completing modules of an online simulation platform called <a href=\"https://www.i-human.com/\" target=\"_blank\">i-Human Patients</a>, graduating Nursing senior Heidi Chiu said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A preceptorship class aims to aid the transition between learning and clinical practice, allowing students to develop specific expertise in a clinical area of their choice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After completing the online modules, graduating Nursing senior Selena Huang said nearly everyone in the senior class was cleared to graduate on time. Huang said she and other students in her clinical group were concerned, however, since the online simulations weren’t tailored to the specific area they had chosen for their preceptorship.</p>\n<p>“I feel like I missed out on a lot of knowledge related to critical care,” Huang said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even after meeting their clinical requirements, Chiu said many graduating<strong> </strong>Nursing seniors are having difficulties applying to jobs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Test dates for the National Council Licensure Examination, the nationwide exam that nurses take to receive their licenses, were <a href=\"https://www.ncsbn.org/14428.htm\" target=\"_blank\">delayed</a> for a few weeks in March in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although testing has restarted, applicants are facing long processing times of up to seven to 12 weeks in states such as <a href=\"https://www.dos.pa.gov/ProfessionalLicensing/BoardsCommissions/Nursing/Pages/Nursing-Guide.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href=\"https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/nur/pages/applications.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">New Jersey,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rn.ca.gov/times.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">California</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Huang, who registered to take the exam in California, said she still has to wait about 10 weeks for her application to take the exam to process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many employers at facilities <a href=\"https://cdn.uconnectlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/74/2020/03/2019_Nursing_Career_Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">popular with Penn graduates</a>, like Penn Medicine, <a href=\"https://careers.peopleclick.com/careerscp/client_pennmedicine/external/jobDetails/jobDetail.html?jobPostId=102280&amp;localeCode=en-us\" target=\"_blank\">require</a> nurses to<strong> </strong>receive their license before starting the job.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Huang said her interview at NYU Langone was postponed because she has not taken the NCLEX yet. Chiu and Huang added that many nursing residencies, which grant jobs to graduates who have scheduled an NCLEX test date but have not yet been licensed, have also<strong> </strong>been canceled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rising Nursing<strong> </strong>seniors were able to complete their Psychiatric nursing clinical component before spring break but they didn't finish their Pediatric nursing rotations, which were scheduled for later in the semester.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Instructors for <a href=\"https://catalog.upenn.edu/courses/nurs/\" target=\"_blank\">NURS 225 Pediatric Nursing</a>, which includes 12 hours of clinical rotations and two hours of lab per week, opted to have students watch recorded online<strong> </strong>scenarios for lab, but chose not to pursue an online clinical solution, rising Nursing senior Jamie Chung said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In an internal announcement sent to Nursing students prior to advanced registration, professors instructed students to keep their Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays open for possible makeup clinicals should the campus reopen in the fall.</p>\n<p>Since rising seniors had not met their clinical instructors by the time online learning started, Chung said there was confusion about the expectations for the course, especially as lectures deviated from their original Monday/Wednesday schedule to Mondays through Thursdays in some weeks.</p>\n<p>Like the graduating Nursing<strong> </strong>seniors, rising Nursing juniors used i-Human Patients to make up their clinical hours for NURS 215 Nursing of Women and Infants. Clinical rotations <a href=\"https://www.registrar.upenn.edu/roster/nurs.html\" target=\"_blank\">had already started</a> before students were sent home and were supposed to continue through the rest of the Spring semester.</p>\n<p>Rising Nursing junior Hannah Pinheiro said although the alternative solutions to missed clinicals were not ideal, she thought the faculty did a great job ensuring students had the best experience possible given the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I’m actually quite impressed that the faculty pulled this together on such short notice, but I truly do think that it’s impossible to find an online simulation that will be as realistic as being on the floor,”&nbsp; Huang said.&nbsp;</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED: </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/penn-nursing-students-canceled-clinicals-reaction\">Canceled Nursing clinicals throw graduation and future course planning into disarray</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/02/penn-ua-nursing-special-election\">UA fills vacant Nursing seat with special election – but only 17 people voted</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/02/penn-nursing-nih-funding-ranking\">Penn Nursing receives most NIH funding for third consecutive year</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"1b6888392d","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"75364","created_at":"2020-05-24 20:39:24","modified_at":"2020-05-25 04:44:07","published_at":"2020-05-25 04:44:01","metadata":[],"hits":"364","normalized_tags":"|105|132|27|10614|15944|","ceo_id":"189474","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"105","uuid":"42eb955e-db56-4cba-a412-4a5b763e9d19","name":"academics","slug":"academics","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"5"},{"id":"132","uuid":"9b693701-241e-45f3-a430-018489cdba1a","name":"top","slug":"top","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"41"},{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"10614","uuid":"e24ffc3d-b37c-471f-92bc-3878acbe55b9","name":"beats","slug":"beats","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"6592"},{"id":"15944","uuid":"976fc270-301a-4463-8af5-c3c254f49315","name":"news-covid","slug":"news-covid","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"16832"}],"authors":[{"id":"7504","uuid":"43a09863-c630-4492-b212-9cba643a004d","name":"Jonathan Huang","email":"","slug":"jonathan-huang","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"8152","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"75364","uuid":"479c0b5a-23fc-4714-9ec3-79dfd8a68437","attachment_uuid":"00853146-9afd-4543-869c-dacfe7cabefe","base_name":"penn-medicine-tents-spring-2020-coronavirus","seo_title":null,"seo_description":null,"seo_image":null,"extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Penn Medicine Tents Spring 2020 Coronavirus.jpg","content":"<p>Penn Medicine facilities, one option for Nursing students to fulfill their rotations at, have put clinical placements on hold indefinitely.</p>","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"4000","width":"6000","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-04-16 17:11:42","modified_at":"2020-05-25 00:07:56","published_at":"2020-04-16 17:12:27","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"188978","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"transcoded":"0"}},"mostReadDP":[{"gaTitle":"Penn outlines four possible scenarios for fall 2020, will finalize plan by end of June | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn outlines four possible scenarios for fall 2020, will finalize plan by end of June","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-update-fall-2020-covid-plan-coronavirus","authors":["Jonah Charlton","Pia Singh"],"views":"23648","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/56cc0847-1de8-46e5-9433-3d0ed01be26f.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Here&#8217;s how Ivy League universities are changing testing requirements for the Class of 2025 | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Here&#8217;s how Ivy League universities are changing testing requirements for the Class of 2025","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-admissions-testing-ivy-league","authors":["Pia Singh"],"views":"8269","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/15d3ef48-48ac-47c4-92ff-2175237b6190.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn ranked eighth best U.S. university by Quacquarelli Symonds | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn ranked eighth best U.S. university by Quacquarelli Symonds","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-ranks-eight-qs-university-ranking","authors":["Serena Zhang"],"views":"7839","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/e3b2c1ef-d420-4b58-a7eb-70a30b2839f0.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Here&#8217;s how the Ivy League is planning for the fall semester | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Here&#8217;s how the Ivy League is planning for the fall semester","path":"/article/2020/04/penn-ivy-league-fall-semester-2020-coronavirus","authors":["Komal Patel"],"views":"7369","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/5bc8d4d2-5900-4ac5-9bba-54140fce3d1b.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Over 200 profs. sign letter demanding U. use endowment to protect grad students | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Over 200 profs. sign letter demanding U. use endowment to protect grad students","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-endowment-graduate-students-coronavirus","authors":["Anya Tullman"],"views":"4963","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/41e504e6-c562-42f3-a9bf-7f97bcbd7911.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"}]}}}
