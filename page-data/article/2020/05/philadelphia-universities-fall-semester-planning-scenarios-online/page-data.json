Institutions in the Philadelphia region are considering many variations of college life, including full in-person instruction, hybrid in-person and virtual instruction, and a fully virtual semester.</p>\n<p>Here is how eight Philadelphia-area colleges are planning for the<strong> </strong>fall.</p>\n<p><strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong></p>\n<p>The University sent an <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/05/penn-update-fall-2020-covid-plan-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">email</a> to the Penn community on May 21 outlining four possible scenarios for the fall semester, stating a final decision will be made by the end of June.</p>\n<p>These four scenarios include a combination of virtual and in-person classes, a shortened in-person semester, increased course offerings for summer 2021, and entirely online learning for the fall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hybrid experience entails a combination of virtual and in-person classes limited to 25 students.</p>\n<p>A shortened semester would consist of in-person instruction with an end to on-campus activities by Thanksgiving, requiring instruction to be<strong> </strong>completed online for the remainder of the semester.</p>\n<p>Increased course offerings for summer 2021 would provide “greater opportunities for earned academic credits and cohort-based experiential learning.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The last alternative is a fully remote fall semester.</p>\n<p>The University also outlined potential efforts to ensure student safety, including implementing six-feet physical distancing measures, providing regular testing for the virus, and placing traffic-reducing measures in dorms, dining halls, and libraries.</p>\n<p><strong>Drexel University</strong></p>\n<p>Drexel's fall COVID-19 Task Force will make a <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/now/archive/2020/May/Focus-on-fall-term-student-experience-civic-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\">recommendation</a> for fall semester operations by the end of May.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/now/archive/2020/May/Focus-on-fall-term-student-experience-civic-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\">email </a>sent to the Drexel community on May 15, the task force reported results from an online survey of students, faculty, and professional staff. The survey showed community<strong> </strong>support to instate enhanced health and safety measures on campus, continued remote learning or a hybrid of in-person and online instruction, flexibility in permitting students to learn from home even if campus activities resume, and staggered schedules to allow for social distancing in labs and studios.</p>\n<p>“Because COVID-19 is in Philadelphia and the surrounding region, we are taking proactive steps to protect our community.\" Drexel President John Fry said in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wo6rIdPXB4&amp;feature=emb_title\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> statement. \"These steps will alter the way that our students learn and how we operate as a university campus.”</p>\n<p><strong>Haverford College</strong></p>\n<p>Haverford's designated coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.haverford.edu/coronavirus-information\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> states the College anticipates a return to on-campus learning in the fall. If the college is unable to begin classes in late August or early September as usual, its<strong> </strong>community will be notified by August 1.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The College is also developing a number of contingency plans, including a combination of virtual and in-person learning and increasing the quality of remote learning experiences.</p>\n<p>If significant portions of the semester must be conducted remotely, Haverford is committed to pro-rating student<strong> </strong>charges such as room and board.</p>\n<p><strong>Saint Joseph’s University</strong></p>\n<p>On April 30, SJU President Mark Reed sent an <a href=\"https://www.sju.edu/status/coronavirus/announcements/april-30-update\" target=\"_blank\">email</a> to the school community stating the University’s plans to welcome students back to campus on August 24 for its regular fall semester schedule, barring any restrictions.</p>\n<p>The four most likely scenarios under consideration include on-campus instruction with social distancing protocols, on-campus instruction that ends by Thanksgiving, a virtual start to the semester with a transition to in-person instruction later on, and having<strong> </strong>a fully virtual semester.</p>\n<p>A Preparation Task Force was<a href=\"https://www.sju.edu/status/coronavirus/announcements/may-8-update-faculty-staff\" target=\"_blank\"> established</a> on April 30 to develop plans for fall semester operations.</p>\n<p>The University's summer orientation, occurring in late June for incoming students, has already been <a href=\"https://www.sju.edu/studentlife/orientation\" target=\"_blank\">moved</a> online.</p>\n<p><strong>Swarthmore College</strong></p>\n<p>Swarthmore President Valerie Smith plans to share a plan for the next academic year by mid to late June, according to an <a href=\"https://www.swarthmore.edu/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-information/academic-continuity-group-update\" target=\"_blank\">email</a> sent to the Swarthmore community on May 14.</p>\n<p>The College's Academic Continuity Working Group outlined the pros and cons of various scenarios for fall semester operations, and delivered its report to President Smith on May 8. The recommendations are currently <a href=\"https://www.swarthmore.edu/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-information/frequently-asked-questions-students-parents-and\" target=\"_blank\">under review</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A survey sent to the student body the following day <a href=\"https://www.swarthmore.edu/sites/default/files/assets/documents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-information/What%20We%20Heard%205.9.20.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> that some students felt &nbsp;online learning would be the “safest way to start or conduct fall semester,” while others stated that they intend to take a leave of absence should classes be online.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We very much share a desire to continue in the fall as we typically would. Yet there is so much we do not, cannot, and will not know — about testing, vaccines, and travel restrictions, among many other constraints — that complicates our ability to plan effectively,” wrote the Academic Continuity Working Group in the May 14 email.</p>\n<p><strong>Temple University</strong></p>\n<p>Temple’s 'Return Team' task force outlined four scenarios currently under consideration for the fall semester in a University <a href=\"https://www.temple.edu/coronavirus/information-returning-students\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>, all of which include an on-campus experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first is a “reasonable normal” scenario, which allows for in-person learning without large lectures and mass gatherings.&nbsp;Recreational facilities, with extra cleaning, will be available in this scenario.</p>\n<p>The “restricted semester” option allows for some in-person learning, with restricted gatherings of a maximum 25 to 50 people, and further restrictions on housing, sports, and recreation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The third option is an “essentials only” scenario, where in-person learning and housing are heavily restricted, with gatherings limited to fewer than 25 people. No sports and recreational activities will be allowed in this scenario.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the fourth “comprehensive remote” option, in-person instruction and gatherings are limited to 10 or fewer people, with priority given to research activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas Jefferson University</strong></p>\n<p>In an April 28 <a href=\"https://www.jefferson.edu/coronavirus.html#updates\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> to all students, President Stephen Klasko wrote that the University plans to resume on-campus classes and operations in the fall.</p>\n<p>To ensure student and faculty safety, plans to create smaller classes will be made by expanding class schedules. TJU is also developing more options for digital learning to take place on campus, and is exploring all-digital learning opportunities for students who do not want to return to campus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The University is also making plans to open residence halls, as well as dining, athletic, and other campus facilities, in a manner that will maximize community<strong> </strong>safety.</p>\n<p><strong>West Chester University</strong></p>\n<p>President Christopher Fiorentino sent an<a href=\"https://www.wcupa.edu/communications/newsroom/2020/05.15update.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"> email</a> to the West Chester University community on May 15, stating a final decision about fall semester operations will be announced in July.</p>\n<p>Fiorentino wrote that his decision will be shaped by the course of the pandemic over the next two months. The University is currently planning a full range of options for consideration, he added, including developing standards for isolating and social distancing on campus, as well as methods and practices of contract tracing for the virus.</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/05/penn-update-fall-2020-covid-plan-coronavirus\">Penn outlines four possible scenarios for fall 2020, will finalize plan by end of June</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/penn-ivy-league-fall-semester-2020-coronavirus\">Here’s how the Ivy League is planning for the fall semester</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"72c96d1c70","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"75724","created_at":"2020-05-25 18:58:48","modified_at":"2020-05-26 03:38:03","published_at":"2020-05-26 03:37:20","metadata":[],"hits":"122","normalized_tags":"|105|27|118|15944|15948|","ceo_id":"189494","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"105","uuid":"42eb955e-db56-4cba-a412-4a5b763e9d19","name":"academics","slug":"academics","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"5"},{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"118","uuid":"f201d73a-6832-4beb-b7f0-14b33aaf9199","name":"front","slug":"front","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"109"},{"id":"15944","uuid":"976fc270-301a-4463-8af5-c3c254f49315","name":"news-covid","slug":"news-covid","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"16832"},{"id":"15948","uuid":"46c6dfbb-0026-42e7-84a7-b8a6e05e9015","name":"covid","slug":"covid","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"16835"}],"authors":[{"id":"7504","uuid":"43a09863-c630-4492-b212-9cba643a004d","name":"Jonathan Huang","email":"","slug":"jonathan-huang","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"8152","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"75724","uuid":"775a4b4f-4db3-495d-8d7b-2a75c87abb71","attachment_uuid":"c67fa81b-a55c-4378-a718-356a98de23e7","base_name":"penn-campus-fall","seo_title":null,"seo_description":null,"seo_image":null,"extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Penn Campus Fall.jpg","content":"<p>Penn is currently considering four scenarios for the fall semester.</p>","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"3713","width":"5570","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-05-26 00:56:37","modified_at":"2020-05-26 03:03:26","published_at":"2020-05-26 00:57:28","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"189514","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"transcoded":"0"}},"mostReadDP":[{"gaTitle":"Penn outlines four possible scenarios for fall 2020, will finalize plan by end of June | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn outlines four possible scenarios for fall 2020, will finalize plan by end of June","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-update-fall-2020-covid-plan-coronavirus","authors":["Jonah Charlton","Pia Singh"],"views":"23610","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/56cc0847-1de8-46e5-9433-3d0ed01be26f.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Here&#8217;s how Ivy League universities are changing testing requirements for the Class of 2025 | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Here&#8217;s how Ivy League universities are changing testing requirements for the Class of 2025","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-admissions-testing-ivy-league","authors":["Pia Singh"],"views":"8244","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/15d3ef48-48ac-47c4-92ff-2175237b6190.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn ranked eighth best U.S. university by Quacquarelli Symonds | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn ranked eighth best U.S. university by Quacquarelli Symonds","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-ranks-eight-qs-university-ranking","authors":["Serena Zhang"],"views":"7803","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/e3b2c1ef-d420-4b58-a7eb-70a30b2839f0.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Here&#8217;s how the Ivy League is planning for the fall semester | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Here&#8217;s how the Ivy League is planning for the fall semester","path":"/article/2020/04/penn-ivy-league-fall-semester-2020-coronavirus","authors":["Komal Patel"],"views":"7347","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/5bc8d4d2-5900-4ac5-9bba-54140fce3d1b.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Over 200 profs. sign letter demanding U. use endowment to protect grad students | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Over 200 profs. sign letter demanding U. use endowment to protect grad students","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-endowment-graduate-students-coronavirus","authors":["Anya Tullman"],"views":"4959","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/41e504e6-c562-42f3-a9bf-7f97bcbd7911.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"}]}}}
