A Penn Medicine <a href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/may/financial-incentives-boost-doctor-training-in-opioid-treatment-medication\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> found that by providing a financial incentive to physicians, however, 89% of physicians would become eligible to provide the medication.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The study was published earlier this month by seven Penn researchers in the field of Emergency Medicine at the Medical School, Penn Medicine News <a href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/may/financial-incentives-boost-doctor-training-in-opioid-treatment-medication\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>. The researchers found that if reimbursement for training and a $750 incentive were offered to the providers, nearly nine out of every ten physicians were fully trained within six weeks.</p>\n<p>The life-saving medication, buprenorphine, works to calm the brain's need for opioids and limit the toxic effects of the drugs, which prevents fatal overdosing, according to Penn Medicine News.</p>\n<p>After receiving the drug certificate training, the study found that 65% of physicians reported administering or prescribing buprenorphine within five months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This study shows how enthusiastically emergency physicians embraced the opportunity to obtain this certification, which speaks to the shifting national conversation surrounding opioid use disorder and the importance of meeting patients where they are,” Sean Foster, the director of Quality Improvement in Emergency Medicine at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, told Penn Medicine News.</p>\n<p>According to the study, the provided financial reimbursement and incentive was the facilitating factor in pushing physicians to devote an entire day to training for the certification. A post-study survey revealed two-thirds of respondents said they would have gotten certified to provide the medication even if the incentive was $500 or less.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The authors of the study told Penn Medicine News they hope to expand the treatment's accessibility for patients by exploring the effectiveness of even shorter training courses for physicians.</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/05/penn-political-partisanship-coronavirus-lockdown\">Penn study finds political beliefs affected how Americans followed distancing guidelines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/05/penn-medicine-coronavirus-spread-research\">Penn study finds that speech can transmit viruses</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"23ca39f030","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"75740","created_at":"2020-05-26 04:45:02","modified_at":"2020-05-26 06:41:55","published_at":"2020-05-26 06:41:25","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"|27|118|121|15919|","ceo_id":"189532","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"118","uuid":"f201d73a-6832-4beb-b7f0-14b33aaf9199","name":"front","slug":"front","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"109"},{"id":"121","uuid":"7f729be1-06b8-475a-a9ee-f95338a1e7d2","name":"penn-medicine","slug":"penn-medicine","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"213"},{"id":"15919","uuid":"d817347b-962b-4316-83c2-f9929cb3c139","name":"real-time","slug":"real-time","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"16799"}],"authors":[{"id":"7489","uuid":"7d0c6a2d-2fb0-4166-9abe-7555b280f0ff","name":"Michelle Huang","email":"","slug":"michelle-huang","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"8133","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"75740","uuid":"9847ce2c-e30f-4e02-8029-8028d17473eb","attachment_uuid":"356be751-437e-4429-a8d6-f2a9b1ccbc99","base_name":"penn-medicine","seo_title":null,"seo_description":null,"seo_image":null,"extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Penn Medicine.jpg","content":"A Penn Medicine study found that financial incentive would encourage 89% of physicians to get proper training to administer buprenorphine.","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"3232","width":"4848","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-05-26 04:47:58","modified_at":"2020-05-26 04:58:51","published_at":"2020-05-26 04:58:51","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"189533","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"transcoded":"0"}},"mostReadDP":[{"gaTitle":"Penn outlines four possible scenarios for fall 2020, will finalize plan by end of June | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn outlines four possible scenarios for fall 2020, will finalize plan by end of June","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-update-fall-2020-covid-plan-coronavirus","authors":["Jonah Charlton","Pia Singh"],"views":"23648","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/56cc0847-1de8-46e5-9433-3d0ed01be26f.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Here&#8217;s how Ivy League universities are changing testing requirements for the Class of 2025 | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Here&#8217;s how Ivy League universities are changing testing requirements for the Class of 2025","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-admissions-testing-ivy-league","authors":["Pia Singh"],"views":"8269","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/15d3ef48-48ac-47c4-92ff-2175237b6190.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn ranked eighth best U.S. university by Quacquarelli Symonds | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn ranked eighth best U.S. university by Quacquarelli Symonds","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-ranks-eight-qs-university-ranking","authors":["Serena Zhang"],"views":"7839","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/e3b2c1ef-d420-4b58-a7eb-70a30b2839f0.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Here&#8217;s how the Ivy League is planning for the fall semester | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Here&#8217;s how the Ivy League is planning for the fall semester","path":"/article/2020/04/penn-ivy-league-fall-semester-2020-coronavirus","authors":["Komal Patel"],"views":"7369","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/5bc8d4d2-5900-4ac5-9bba-54140fce3d1b.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Over 200 profs. sign letter demanding U. use endowment to protect grad students | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Over 200 profs. sign letter demanding U. use endowment to protect grad students","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-endowment-graduate-students-coronavirus","authors":["Anya Tullman"],"views":"4963","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/41e504e6-c562-42f3-a9bf-7f97bcbd7911.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800"}]}}}
