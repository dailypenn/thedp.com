All schools in the Ivy League have not yet announced decisions and are leaving many options on the table, although some have ruled out canceling the fall semester entirely.</p>\n<p>Here’s what all eight Ivy League universities are planning for Fall 2020. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong></p>\n<p>On April 27, Penn <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/penn-fall-coronavirus-2020-recovery-planning-group\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> it is considering a combination of virtual and in-person classes for the upcoming fall semester.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In an email to the Penn community, Penn President Amy Gutmann announced that a Recovery Planning Group has been established to determine when normal campus operations can resume. The group is considering the school’s capacity for testing, contact tracing, and isolating abilities of COVID-19 positive individuals, as well as maximizing single-bedroom living possibilities for students.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While Gutmann called the combination of in-class and virtual teaching “likely,” she did not announce when campus would reopen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“At this point, it is too early to say exactly when or how that will happen, but we wanted to update you on our thinking and planning, and we will continue to do so,” Gutmann wrote in the email.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Brown University</strong></p>\n<p>Brown President Christina Paxson wrote to the Brown community that she is \"cautiously optimistic\" that students will be able to return in the fall, but has not made a definitive decision.</p>\n<p>Paxson <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/brown-president-opinion-colleges-must-reopen\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> an op-ed in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/opinion/coronavirus-colleges-universities.html?referringSource=articleShare\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a> explaining that universities must open in the fall to avoid a higher education crisis. Calling the reopening of college and university campuses a “national priority,” Paxson wrote that a failure to open in the fall would present grave economic consequences for universities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Our duty now is to marshal the resources and expertise to make it possible to reopen our campuses, safely, as soon as possible,” Paxson wrote. “Our students, and our local economies, depend on it.”</p>\n<p>Paxson created a <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/news/2020-04-13/healthy-fall\" target=\"_blank\">Healthy Fall 2020 Task Force</a> to plan the reopening of Brown's campus next semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Columbia University</strong></p>\n<p>Columbia has <a href=\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2020/04/16/as-the-pandemic-rages-on-columbia-braces-for-widespread-financial-fallout/\" target=\"_blank\">not yet announced</a> a decision regarding the fall semester.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Columbia Daily Spectator reported that the University is bracing for a \"widespread financial fallout,\" which could be exacerbated by not opening in the fall.</p>\n<p>New York City is the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html\" target=\"_blank\">epicenter of the coronavirus</a> in the United States, with more than 170,000 cases and 17,000 deaths as of April 29.</p>\n<p><strong>Cornell University</strong></p>\n<p>Cornell has not yet announced a decision for the fall semester. Cornell President Martha Pollack <a href=\"https://statements.cornell.edu/2020/20200422-Y7Akb-planning-update.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a><strong> </strong>on April 22 the creation of four planning committees to recommend when normal operations should resume. The committees are set to present their conclusions by the end of June.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“While we are committed to making a decision as early as possible, we are also committed to making that decision in a principled way, taking into account both the guidance of public health officials and a careful analysis of our own situation,” Pollack wrote. “We therefore don’t anticipate an announcement before the committees complete their work.”</p>\n<p>This announcement comes after Cornell <a href=\"https://cornellsun.com/2020/04/20/pre-enrollment-pushed-to-june-for-fall-semester/\" target=\"_blank\">pushed</a> pre-enrollment for fall 2020 courses back, for the second time, to mid to late June.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Dartmouth College</strong></p>\n<p>Dartmouth has not yet released a definitive plan for the fall term.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2020/04/college-students-prepare-for-remote-summer-term-fall-plans-remain-uncertain\" target=\"_blank\">According</a> <a href=\"https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2020/04/college-students-prepare-for-remote-summer-term-fall-plans-remain-uncertain\" target=\"_blank\">to The Dartmouth</a>, a coronavirus task force is now focusing on the fall term, after making the decision to shift summer courses online. A decision should be announced in the “June to July timeframe.”</p>\n<p>“The probability of a full, residential, business-as-usual fall term is not very high,” Dartmouth Provost Joseph Helble told The Dartmouth. “That said, we are still in the very early stages of gathering information needed to make a decision.”</p>\n<p><strong>Harvard University</strong></p>\n<p>Harvard <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/28/harvard-coronavirus-garber-fall-2020-email/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that the University will open in the fall, but it is not certain whether classes will be held on campus or virtually.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to bring our students, faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and staff to campus as quickly as possible,” Harvard Provost Alan Garber wrote in the announcement, “but because most projections suggest that COVID-19 will remain a serious threat during the coming months, we cannot be certain that it will be safe to resume all usual activities on campus by then.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Garber wrote that a range of solutions have been, and will continue to be, considered, including a normal return to campus and a virtual beginning.</p>\n<p><strong>Princeton University</strong></p>\n<p>On April 23, Princeton <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/04/23/university-evaluating-teaching-and-research-plans-campus-operations-next-academic\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that it is exploring a variety of options regarding the fall 2020 semester.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The decision will be made by the Academic Year 2021 Coordinating Committee, which is chaired by Princeton Provost Debbie Prentice, according to the announcement. A deadline has not been announced for the decision regarding the upcoming semester.</p>\n<p>The University also said there may be different timelines for resuming on-campus teaching versus on-campus research.</p>\n<p><strong>Yale University</strong></p>\n<p>Yale has not yet decided when students will return to campus. President Peter Salovey <a href=\"https://news.yale.edu/2020/04/21/yale-months-ahead\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the creation of six <a href=\"https://covid19.yale.edu/announcements/covid-19-contingency-planning-committees\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 contingency planning committees</a>, which will suggest recommendations for how Yale can safely operate in the fall and beyond.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Salovey wrote that a decision about the fall will be announced no later than early July, according to the announcement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I understand that we all need time to make plans,” Salovey wrote. “If we can do so sooner, we will. And on an ongoing basis, we will provide guidance bearing on spring and summer.”</p>\n<p>On April 28, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont told <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/28/connecticut-governor-ned-lamont-wants-states-colleges-open-in-fall.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a> that he wants colleges in Connecticut to reopen campus in the fall if it is safe to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We have the best and the brightest coming to Connecticut to get educated,” Lamont said. “It’d be a shame that they didn’t come.\"</p>","infobox":"<p><strong>RELATED:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/penn-fall-coronavirus-2020-recovery-planning-group\">Penn considers combination of virtual and in-person classes for fall 2020</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/wistar-penn-med-coronavirus-vaccine-human-testing\">Wistar Institute and Penn Medicine start testing coronavirus vaccine on humans</a></p>","template":null,"short_token":"545459663f","status":"0","weight":"5","media_id":"75497","created_at":"2020-04-30 02:02:17","modified_at":"2020-05-01 01:51:30","published_at":"2020-04-30 04:52:06","metadata":[],"hits":"45198","normalized_tags":"|105|132|27|154|","ceo_id":"189170","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"tags":[{"id":"105","uuid":"42eb955e-db56-4cba-a412-4a5b763e9d19","name":"academics","slug":"academics","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"5"},{"id":"132","uuid":"9b693701-241e-45f3-a430-018489cdba1a","name":"top","slug":"top","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"41"},{"id":"27","uuid":"df02f871-f8a2-4d65-88d2-b80eaaff54b5","name":"news","slug":"news","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"108"},{"id":"154","uuid":"9e64ae9e-2126-42c3-aae8-673b29b8fc79","name":"ivy-league","slug":"ivy-league","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"204"}],"authors":[{"id":"7411","uuid":"dc6e705a-00d2-42ca-b29b-da2f08a195c3","name":"Komal Patel","email":"kpatel19@sas.upenn.edu","slug":"komal-patel","bio":"","tagline":"","metadata":null,"ceo_id":"8051","status":"1"}],"dominantMedia":{"id":"75497","uuid":"1b44ecae-1e3c-4775-98db-4c58f678581a","attachment_uuid":"411d780c-1ba2-4604-a743-f9275e1542ed","base_name":"fall-college-hall-benjamin-franklin","seo_title":null,"seo_description":null,"seo_image":null,"extension":"jpg","preview_extension":"jpg","title":"Fall College Hall Benjamin Franklin.jpg","content":"<p>Penn has not yet announced when campus will reopen.</p>","source":null,"click_through":null,"type":"image","height":"3825","width":"5738","status":"0","weight":"0","created_at":"2020-04-30 03:51:06","modified_at":"2020-04-30 04:09:41","published_at":"2020-04-30 03:51:24","metadata":[],"hits":"0","normalized_tags":"||","svg_preview":null,"ceo_id":"189171","ssts_id":null,"ssts_path":null,"transcoded":"0"}},"mostReadDP":[{"gaTitle":"While colleges struggle to fill Class of 2024, Penn has not yet increased waitlist admissions | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"While colleges struggle to fill Class of 2024, Penn has not yet increased waitlist admissions","path":"/article/2020/05/penn-waitlist-admissions-coronavirus","authors":["Pia Singh"],"views":"10190","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/0fa49206-e8b7-4935-93d7-757f85f92160.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Here&#8217;s how the Ivy League is planning for the fall semester | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Here&#8217;s how the Ivy League is planning for the fall semester","path":"/article/2020/04/penn-ivy-league-fall-semester-2020-coronavirus","authors":["Komal Patel"],"views":"5186","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/411d780c-1ba2-4604-a743-f9275e1542ed.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Penn will hold the Class of 2020&#39;s in-person commencement in May 2021 | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Penn will hold the Class of 2020&#39;s in-person commencement in May 2021","path":"/article/2020/05/class-of-2020-commencement-in-person-may-2021-graduation-upenn-penn","authors":["Max Cohen"],"views":"3703","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/98bd22a0-18c9-434b-858e-65448c53b005.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"While prof. speculates fall classes will be remote, U. maintains no decision has been made | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"While prof. speculates fall classes will be remote, U. maintains no decision has been made","path":"/article/2020/04/penn-coronavirus-fall-2020-classes-online-cis-professor","authors":["Ashley Ahn"],"views":"2289","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/c141d0d1-7f73-4fc0-8e7e-0e8c6eebe7c3.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"},{"gaTitle":"Photo Essay | Students reflect on life inside the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic | The Daily Pennsylvanian","ogTitle":"Photo Essay | Students reflect on life inside the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic","path":"/article/2020/05/coronavirus-covid-19-new-york-city-empty-students-photo-essay","authors":["Chase Sutton"],"views":"2156","image":"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/3cafc1be-387f-4d5f-936a-844f36f4a8d7.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800"}]}}}
